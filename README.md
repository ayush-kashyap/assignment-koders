## Project Overview

This is a basic version of an Ecommerce APP. Focused more towards meeting the assignment guidelines rather than the Actual functionalities of an Ecommerce App.

**It uses:**
1. Flutter version  **3.38.1**
2. Dart version  **3.10.0**

State management used is **GetX**

I have used the **MVC architecture**

Used **Dio** for API Integrations

Uses Public API https://fakestoreapi.com/

**It has the following Screens:** 
1. Login Screen 
2. Dashboard
3. Product View

The validations are only for checking not empty values as the Public API accepts usernames with no formatting, the password follow no strict guidelines.

I have included comments wherever possible.

I have used Shimmer for managing the loading status of dashboard.

Couldn't show pagination because the API does not support it. Implementation of pull to refresh is there.


***Note :*** _This project is made keeping in mind to meed the guidelines and not the functionalities, That's the only reason I have dropped the idea of creating Cart and other features an Ecommerce app should have, And focused more on smoothing the User experience. If given time I can develop much more than that as well._
